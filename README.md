# CybervoidOS
For everyone, to everything with lightning fast enviroment and stunning look.

## Bootloader
I'm building bootloader with UEFI. I use GNU-EFI to build a bootloader because EDK2 was too complicated and time-consuming to setup for me.

## OS
My dream is creating a "Linux for casual Windows users". Basically an operating system that combines the best traits of Windows and Linux: lightweight, designed for users demanding reliable enviroment, clean interface and a possibility to adjust the system configuration to user needs.

I'm considering using Linux kernel as a base but there are some difficulties I have to overcome to fulfill the mission of my project.

All contributions and ideas are welcome.
